## FlashAir Commander

Easily transfer files from your Toshiba FlashAir SD-card to your smart phone

This app provides an easy way to transfer your files from the Toshiba FlashAir SD-card to your smart phone or tablet.
The main difference to the original app from Toshiba is the ability to manually set the IP address of the card. If the SD-card is connected to Wi-Fi as client you're able to access the card from your smart phone.

I'm trying to impove it regulary and to fix bugs as soon as possible. But nevertheless it's still in BETA state.

**Features:**
* Shows the contents of the SD-card
* Shows the thumbnails of the images
* Browse the directories on the SD-card
* Mark one or more files for transfer
* Target download folder adjustable (default pictured folder or self defined directory)
* Deleting of successful transferred files.

**Not yet implemented but nice to have features:**
* Automatic transfer of files to the smart phone when the FlashAir wifi is connected.
* Edit of the settings/config on the FlashAir card.
* Display of photos in large format when clicked.

This app is beerware. :-)
